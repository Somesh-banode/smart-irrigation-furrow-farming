# Smart Irrigation for Furrow Farming 🌱

## 🚀 Overview
A low-cost IoT-based irrigation system designed to automate water delivery in furrow farming based on real-time soil moisture sensing, helping farmers conserve water and improve crop yield.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Water wastage in agriculture is a major issue. Manual irrigation lacks precision and consistency. Our system provides smart, real-time water control to minimize waste.

## 💡 Solution
- ESP8266-based wireless controller
- Soil moisture sensors to detect dryness
- Automated solenoid valves for irrigation control
- Optional dashboard via Firebase for remote monitoring

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- ESP8266 Microcontroller
- Soil Moisture Sensors
- Blynk Dashboard
- Arduino IDE (C++)
- Optional Web/App UI (mention if included)

## 🧩 Features
- Automated irrigation based on soil moisture
- Scalable for multiple furrows
- Real-time monitoring (optional)
- Energy-efficient and cost-effective
